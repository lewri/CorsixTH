<!-- It is often useful for us if you have a save game from shortly before the issue occurs that can be used to recreate the problem. Sometimes a save that shows the issue happening may be useful as well.
You can upload your save by putting it in zip file, then copy/pasting it directly into this text area. You can also click the "Attach files by dragging & dropping, selecting or pasting them" text at the bottom to upload the zip file.
Alternatively, you can use an external source such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive and sharing the public link below to access your save game. The most important thing is to not remove these files after you upload them. -->

<!-- It is often useful for us if you have a save game from shortly before the issue occurs that can be used to recreate the problem. Sometimes a save that shows the issue happening may be useful as well. As GitHub currently only supports uploading of images, you will have to upload your your savegames to
an another source such as Google Drive: https://drive.google.com , Dropbox: https://dropbox.com , or OneDrive: https://onedrive.live.com . Add the link to the file to your issue and make the file(s) public, so we can access your gamelog or savegame. The most important thing is to not remove these files after you uploaded them!
